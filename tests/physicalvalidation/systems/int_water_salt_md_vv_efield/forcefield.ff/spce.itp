; nrexcl = 2 stands for excluding non-bonded interactions between atoms that are no further than 2 bonds away.

[ atoms ]
; defines the molecule, where nr and type are fixed, the rest is user defined. So atom can be named as you like, cgnr made larger or smaller (if possible, the total charge of a charge group should be zero), and charges can be changed here too.
